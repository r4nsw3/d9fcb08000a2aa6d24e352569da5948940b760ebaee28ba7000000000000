  |   You're moving to the valley...                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew          |
  |   Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out    |
  |   to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn   |
  |   these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever   |
  |   since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all    |
  |   but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant   |
  |   hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of   |
  |   opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to   |
  |   restore Stardew Valley to greatness!                                  |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update Notes: v1.4.3 (v458752). Firmware 9.1.0 is required.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   ConcernedApe has long been working on the 1.4 content update for      |
  |   Stardew Valley. We now have another update from the developer with    |
  |   latest details along with more news on when we can expect it on       |
  |   Switch.                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Here's the lowdown from ConcernedApe:                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now, the next big thing for Stardew Valley is going to be the free    |
  |   1.4 update, which adds a pretty big variety of new things to          |
  |   Stardew Valley. One of my main goals with 1.4 was to finally          |
  |   "polish" the game to the degree that I've always wanted. What I       |
  |   mean by that is that I wanted to fix all the bugs that have been      |
  |   lingering in the game, to fix a lot of weird or annoying things       |
  |   about the controls & feel of the game, and add in a lot of "quality   |
  |   of life" features that will make the game more seamless to play. I    |
  |   feel pretty confident that this goal has been met!                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Content-wise, nearly every aspect of the game has been expanded or    |
  |   improved upon in some way.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   One small example is the Wild Bait... which used to be essentially    |
  |   worthless... but now gives you a chance to catch double fish.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There's a lot of little things like that, where I felt that the       |
  |   game had some holes or weak points that could use a little boost.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Another example, is that every spouse now has a unique 14-heart       |
  |   event after marriage:                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There is more end-game stuff like that to keep things going a         |
  |   little further after you've completed everything. I don't want to     |
  |   spoil very much, so you'll just have to wait and see for yourself!    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   1.4 is currently in the final stages, just doing some last minute     |
  |   tweaks and fixing the rare bug...                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   My goal is for the update to release on consoles & mobile             |
  |   simultaneously a few weeks after PC. Once 1.4 has a little more       |
  |   testing on these platforms, I hope to give a solid release date for   |
  |   them.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Miscellaneous:                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Also, the 1.4 update marks the first time in Stardew's history        |
  |   where I've worked on new content with other people. After 7 years     |
  |   of working completely solo, I formed a small team earlier this year   |
  |   to help me continue working on Stardew Valley. Originally, my plan    |
  |   was to do 1.4 completely solo, but the timing of it all didn't work   |
  |   out that way, so 1.4 ended up being a team project. It's all very     |
  |   small scale (1.4 was made with the help of 2 other people, and the    |
  |   team is currently just me and one other person), but having some      |
  |   help (particularly on the technical/programming side of things) is    |
  |   nice & will be good for Stardew Valley. It means that there will be   |
  |   a lot more in each update than I could do alone. I am still working   |
  |   on an unannounced project completely solo, though, with no plans to   |
  |   bring anyone else on.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   ConcernedApe says that version 1.4 "has some optimization             |
  |   improvements that should make performance better on consoles".        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This update not only adds new content and features to the game, but   |
  |   improves the gameplay experience significantly with tons of           |
  |   "quality of life" features... including some things the community     |
  |   has requested for a long time. There's also an enormous amount of     |
  |   bug fixes and some optimizations improvements - in short, the game    |
  |   is more polished than ever. I hope this update will greatly improve   |
  |   your Stardew Valley experience, and make your time in the valley      |
  |   even more joyful, seemless, and fun.                                  |
